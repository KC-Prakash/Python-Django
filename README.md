## Python Basics

### Hello, World!

Letâ€™s write your first Python program:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

### Variables and Data Types

```python
# Variables
name = "Alice"
age = 25
height = 5.6  # in feet

# Data Types
is_student = True
languages = ["English", "Spanish", "Python"]
```

### Control Flow

```python
# If-else
if age > 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are a minor.")

# Loops
for language in languages:
    print(f"I know {language}.")
```

### Functions

```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("Alice"))
```
